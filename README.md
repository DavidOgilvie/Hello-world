# Hello-world
Test project to learn basics of GitHub
My name is David Ogilvie and I have been a system developer for quite a few decades, starting out with FORTAN and COBOL projects
then using Pascal and Lisp, then C.  Much of my coding experience was in the 1980's and 1990's, and coding has not been my
day job since 1995.  Although my job was not coding, I did a lot of development work in Corel WordPerfect PerfectScript
to generate complicated reports that were produced as WordPerfect documents.  PerfectScript is very similar to C in how it
is coded.  I have not yet delved into C++, Python or HTML.  Now that I have retired, I now have plenty of time to explore
ideas that I have gathered over the years.  My first project is to be an entirely new method of performing OCR.  I am
investigating GitHub as a method of obtaining some of the basic stricture for accessing raw scanner data and manipulating
metadata obtained from the scanned images.
